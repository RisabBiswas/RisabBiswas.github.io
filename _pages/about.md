<span style="font-size: 15px; color: #1B1212;">I am currently working as the Principal AI Engineer at <a href="https://www.p360.com/" style="text-decoration: none; color: #4040FF;">P360</a>, building <a href="https://www.p360.com/edenhelp/" style="text-decoration: none; color: #4040FF;">EdenHelp</a>. I joined P360 in 2018 as a founding data scientist. As an AI Engineer at P360, I have the fortune of working across diverse areas of machine learning and statistical modelling including natural language understanding for conversational AI, hybrid models combining intent-driven and generative approaches, time series forecasting and optimization techniques, and predictive modelling within the pharmaceutical sector. My research interest broadly includes <strong>Computer Vision, Vision and Language Modalities, Self and Semi-Supervised Learning and Natural Language Understanding</strong>.

<span style="font-size: 15px; color: #1B1212;">I completed my Bachelor's (B.Tech) in 2018 in Computer Science and Engineering, where I was the Rank 1 of my department. I was advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=pixVZ0oAAAAJ&hl=en" style="text-decoration: none; color: #4040FF;">Prof. Anupam Mukherjee</a> during my <a href="https://devmesh.intel.com/projects/self-driving-bot-on-intel-architecture#about-section" style="text-decoration: none; color: #4040FF;">Bachelor's Thesis Project</a>. I hold a master's in Data Science and Engineering from the Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, India. During my master's I worked on multiple research projects on effective and efficient document image enhancement with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1WVrFGwAAAAJ&hl=en" style="text-decoration: none; color: #4040FF;">Prof. Swalpa Kumar Roy</a>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2_z_CogAAAAJ&hl=en" style="text-decoration: none; color: #4040FF;">Prof. Umapada Pal</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=LhSqQCIAAAAJ&hl=en" style="text-decoration: none; color: #4040FF;">Prof. Guang-Bin Huang</a>. I was also a master's thesis student at <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/" style="text-decoration: none; color: #4040FF;">University of Glasgow</a> advised by <a href="https://chaitanya-kaul.github.io/" style="text-decoration: none; color: #4040FF;">Dr. Chaitanya Kaul</a>, where I worked on building efficient medical imaging model.


<span style="font-size: 15px; color: #1B1212;">Apart from my job and research, I have been actively involved in the community. Since 2018, I have been a part of the <a href="https://devmesh.intel.com/users/risab-biswas" style="text-decoration: none; color: #4040FF;">Intel Innovator's Program</a> and was recognized as the top innovator in 2019. In 2020, I was awarded the first <a href="https://devmesh.intel.com/posts/638312/congrats-to-our-devmesh-spotlight-award-winners" style="text-decoration: none; color: #4040FF;">Devmesh AI Spotlight Award</a>. I also co-organized the Google Developer Group in Siliguri. I have received both hardware and monetary grants from Intel under their Early Innovation Challenge to support my research projects.

<span style="font-size: 15px; color: #1B1212;"><strong>Note - I am actively seeking a full time PhD position in Computer Vision and Deep Learning!</strong></span>
