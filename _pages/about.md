ðŸŽ¯ Passionate Technical Lead and Hobby Researcher with Expertise in AI, Computer Vision, and NLP. I am currently serving as an Applied Machine Learning Scientist at P360. I have 5+ years of experience in Data Science, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning in the Pharmaceutical domain. I am currently pursuing a Master's degree from the Birla Institute of Engineering and Science, Pilani, India. I have been an Intel Software Innovator since 2018 and have been awarded the Top Innovator Award in 2019 and the Intel AI Spotlight Award in 2019. I recently became a Kaggle Expert in the discussion section. I have been an invited guest speaker at premier institutes like ISI Kolkata, IIT Kanpur, IIT-BHU, NIT Rourkela, NIT Durgapur, Jadavpur University, VIT University, SMIT, and many more to talk about AI research and the latest trends. Currently, I am also associated with doing research with Dr. Swalpa Kumar Roy (JGEC) and Dr. Umapada Pal (ISI Kolkata), working on a variety of computer vision problems. 

My Research interest lies in the field of Deep Learning, particularly in using Vision Transformers and Graph Neural Networks with applications in Image Classification, Object Detection, Image Restoration, and Enhancement. I am actively expanding my knowledge in self-supervised learning, few-shot learning, Representation Learning, and Contrastive Learning for various computer vision problems.
