Hi there! I am Risab Biswas. I am working as the Principal AI Engineer at [P360](https://www.p360.com/), where I lead the AI team. We are currently building [EdenHelp](https://www.p360.com/edenhelp/). I did my post graduation in Data Science and Engineering from Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, India. Previously I was a master's thesis student advised by Dr. [Chaitanya Kaul](https://chaitanya-kaul.github.io/), where I worked on building efficient medical imaging architecture.
