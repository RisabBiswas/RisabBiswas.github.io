<span style="font-size: 15px; color: #3030A0;">I am currently working as the Principal AI Engineer at <a href="https://www.p360.com/" style="text-decoration: none; color: #4040FF;">P360</a>, building <a href="https://www.p360.com/edenhelp/" style="text-decoration: none; color: #4040FF;">EdenHelp</a>. I joined P360 in 2018 as a founding data scientist. As an AI Engineer at P360, I have the fortune of working across diverse areas of machine learning and statistical modelling including natural language understanding for conversational AI, hybrid models combining intent-driven and generative approaches, time series forecasting and optimization techniques, and predictive modelling within the pharmaceutical sector. My research interest broadly includes <strong>Computer Vision, Vision and Language Modalities, Self and Semi-Supervised Learning and Natural Language Understanding</strong>.

<span style="font-size: 15px;">I completed my Bachelor's (B.Tech) in 2018 in Computer Science and Engineering, where I was the Rank 1 of my department. I was advised by [Prof. Anupam Mukherjee](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=pixVZ0oAAAAJ&hl=en) during my [Bachelor's Thesis Project](https://devmesh.intel.com/projects/self-driving-bot-on-intel-architecture#about-section). I hold a master's in Data Science and Engineering from the Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, India. During my master's I worked on multiple research projects on effective and efficient document image enhancement with [Prof. Swalpa Kumar Roy](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1WVrFGwAAAAJ&hl=en), [Prof. Umapada Pal](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2_z_CogAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Guang-Bin Huang](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=LhSqQCIAAAAJ&hl=en). I was also a master's thesis student at [University of Glasgow] advised by [Dr. Chaitanya Kaul](https://chaitanya-kaul.github.io/), where I worked on building efficient medical imaging architecture.

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Apart from my job and research, I have been active in the community. I have been a part of the [Intel Innovator's Program](https://devmesh.intel.com/users/risab-biswas) since 2018. I have been recognised as the top innovator in 2019. In 2020 I was awarded the first [Devmesh AI Spotlight Award](https://devmesh.intel.com/posts/638312/congrats-to-our-devmesh-spotlight-award-winners). I was also a co-organiser for Google Developer Group, Siliguri. I have received both hardware and monetary grants from Intel under their Early Innovation Challenge to support my research projects.

<span style="font-size: 15px;"><strong>Note - I am actively seeking a full time PhD position in Computer Vision and Deep Learning!</strong></span>
