<p style="font-size: 15px;">I have been actively involved in the community since my undergraduate days. From volunteering in the technical events to organizing and presenting at conferences, I have always enjoyed interacting with fellow developers and have contributed in open source by sharing my knowledge. I have held multiple positions in community and academic services:

- <a href="https://devmesh.intel.com/users/risab-biswas">Became an Intel Software Innovator.</a>
- Co-Organizer - Google Developer Group, Siliguri, India. 
- <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PUviI2FxtV-mfRT5WPlbyiWEuP_amjg2/view?usp=sharing">Intel IoT Innovator's Board Member.</a>
- <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l_L1UVTBUMRBYmjxDohBHnSM1K01qvXQ/view?usp=sharing">Intel OneAPI Innovator.</a>
