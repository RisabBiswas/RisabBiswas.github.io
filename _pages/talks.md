<p style="font-size: 14px; color: #1B1212">I enjoy sharing my experiences and insights gained from exploring the fields of machine learning and computer vision. I love discussing the projects I've worked on, the challenges I've faced, and the solutions I've discovered. Teaching undergraduate and graduate students about computer vision concepts is a passion of mine, and it's something I could do for the rest of my life that is learning, experimenting, and teaching. Here are a few talks I've given at community meetups, conferences, and larger events, where I've had the pleasure of discussing my journey and helping others learn something new.</p>
